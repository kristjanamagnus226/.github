# Hi there! 👋  

I’m a passionate and experienced software developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. I thrive in solving complex problems and turning ideas into reality through clean, well-structured code. My journey in tech has led me to work with a variety of languages, frameworks, and tools, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
Here’s a glimpse of the technologies I work with:  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Django, Flask, Express, Spring Boot  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub Actions, Terraform  
- **Tools**: Git, VSCode, IntelliJ, Postman, Jira  

## 🔭 Current Focus  
I’m currently diving deeper into **cloud-native development** and **microservices architecture**, exploring how to build resilient and scalable systems. I’m also experimenting with **Rust** for systems programming and **WebAssembly** for high-performance web applications.  

## 🌱 Always Learning  
I believe in continuous improvement and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in tech. Right now, I’m exploring:  
- **Machine Learning** with TensorFlow and PyTorch  
- **Blockchain** and smart contract development with Solidity  
- **Game Development** using Unity and Godot

- **[Blockchain Demo](https://github.com/kristjanamagnus226/blockchain-demo)**: A simple blockchain implementation in Python.  

## 💡 My Approach to Development  
I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also clean, readable, and maintainable. I follow best practices like **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**, **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**, and **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**. I’m a strong advocate for **test-driven development (TDD)** and **continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines to ensure high-quality software delivery.  

## 🎯 Interests  
Outside of coding, I’m passionate about:  
- **Open Source**: I love contributing to open-source projects and giving back to the community.  
- **Mentorship**: I enjoy helping junior developers grow and sharing my knowledge through blogs and tutorials.  
- **Gaming**: I’m an avid gamer and love exploring the intersection of gaming and technology.  
- **Travel**: I’m always up for an adventure and enjoy exploring new cultures and cuisines.
